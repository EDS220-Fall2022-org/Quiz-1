# Quiz 1
----------------

The goal of this assignment is to let you become familiar with some of the pros and cons of the environmental data sources we discussed in class, and to get some practice working with APIs to perform data I/O. 

Take a look through the Jupyter notebook in this repository, which contains some self-guided exercises related to environmental data sources and accessing data/metadata via API servers. Then fill out the following Google quiz based on the notebook contents!

__Work individually__ and do not share with your classmates until after the assigment is completed.
